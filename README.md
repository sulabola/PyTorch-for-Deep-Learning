# PyTorch for Deep Learning

Deep learning has become a cornerstone of modern data science, enabling powerful solutions in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. This repository documents my structured learning journey through the Udemy course *“PyTorch for Deep Learning with Python Bootcamp.”*

PyTorch is a widely used open-source deep learning framework that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment. Its deep integration with Python and dynamic computational graph makes it especially suitable for building, training, and experimenting with neural network models.

This repository combines theoretical understanding with hands-on Jupyter notebook implementations. It will progressively include practical exercises, model implementations, and experiments covering core deep learning architectures such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

The primary objective of this repository is to develop a solid end-to-end understanding of deep learning workflows using PyTorch and to build reproducible implementations that can be extended to real-world analytical and forecasting problems.
